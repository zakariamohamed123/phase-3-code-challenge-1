# Wk1-phase-3-Code-Challenge-
1. Create and clone a new repository
2. create new files and give them a name ending with .py to show they are python files.

  # Challenge1

  Here i used conditional statements that would convert time from 12 hour clock to 24 hour clock, am to pm and vice versa.

  # Challenge 2

In this challenge i was supposed to write a function that would return true boolean if 2 of the 3 numbers were greater than 0 and false if more than 2 numbers were less than 0.
So i used if statement and conditional operators to create a loop for this.

  # Challenge 3

  In this file given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".
